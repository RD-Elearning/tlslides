# Product & Architecture Review — tlslides as an AI Slide Builder

**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Reviewed commit:** `1f9eeb4a` (branch `main`)
**Scope:** Can this repo become a Canva-style, AI-assisted slide product?

Every claim in these documents was verified by reading source in this repo. Statements are
cited as `path:line`. Where something does **not** exist, that is stated explicitly — absence
was checked by grep, not assumed.

## Executive summary

### The three questions you asked

**1. "Shape lines are hand-drawn — can I make line style configurable?"**

Partly a misunderstanding, and that is good news. Four line styles **already exist** —
`DashStyle` is `draw | solid | dashed | dotted` (`packages/tldraw/src/types.ts:433-438`) and the
style panel already renders all four. Everything looks hand-drawn only because
`defaultStyle.dash = DashStyle.Draw` and `defaultTextStyle.font = FontStyle.Script` (Caveat
Brush) are the defaults (`packages/tldraw/src/state/shapes/shared/shape-styles.ts:174-186`).
**Changing two constants gives you a clean, non-sketchy editor today.**

The real gap is not line *style* but style *expressiveness*: 12 fixed named colors with no hex
(`types.ts:412-425`), 3 fixed stroke widths (2 / 3.5 / 5 px,
`shape-styles.ts:73-77`), 4 fonts, no opacity, no gradients, no shadows, no corner-radius
control, no per-side borders. That is the actual distance to Canva. See document 2.

**2. "Is the API enough for a Next.js app to control it?"**

**Yes for imperative control, no for declarative control.** The `TldrawApp` instance handed to
`onMount` exposes a large, genuinely usable API: `createShapes`, `updateShapes`, `loadDocument`,
`createPage`/`changePage`, `style`, `align`, `group`, camera and selection control. `apps/www`
is a working in-repo proof that this composes with Next.js.

But `<Tldraw>` is **uncontrolled** — it owns its state. You cannot hold the document in React or
server state and push it down as a prop: `updateDocument` never deletes pages
(`TldrawApp.ts:1312-1321`), the `document`-prop path has no echo-loop guard, and
`patchState`/`replaceState` are `protected` (`StateManager.ts:195-230`). The supported
architecture is: seed once with `loadDocument`, drive imperatively, persist from `onPersist`.
See document 3 for the recommended adapter design and 13 specific friction points.

**3. "Can I add custom Next.js block components to the UI?"**

**Not today, but the mechanism is already there and the fix is small.**
`HTMLContainer` renders *arbitrary React children* into real, camera-transformed DOM
(`packages/core/src/components/HTMLContainer/HTMLContainer.tsx:1-20`), and existing shapes
already mount live `<textarea>`, `<img>` and `<video>` elements this way. `@tlslides/core` is
fully open — `Renderer` takes `shapeUtils` as a prop.

The blocker is entirely in `@tlslides/tldraw`: `shapeUtils` is a hardcoded object literal with
no registration API (`packages/tldraw/src/state/shapes/index.ts:25-36`), `TDShapeUtil` is not
exported from the package root (`packages/tldraw/src/index.ts:1-5`), and `TDShapeType` is a
closed enum. The recommended fix is one new `ComponentShape` type plus a `components` registry
prop on `<Tldraw>`, keyed by a serializable `componentId`. See document 4.

### The finding that matters most (that you did not ask about)

**There is no slide frame.** A "slide" is literally a tldraw page (`types.ts:144`) with no width,
height, bounds, or aspect ratio anywhere in the data model. Every slide is an unbounded infinite
canvas.

This one absence blocks almost everything you want:

- **Templates** cannot define where elements go without a coordinate space to place them in.
- **AI generation** has no canvas dimensions to lay content out against.
- **Thumbnails** currently fake a preview by scaling whatever camera the author last left
  (`Deck.tsx:38-51`) — so the deck panel shows arbitrary framing per slide.
- **Export** sizes each slide to its content bounding box (`TldrawApp.ts:3608-3619`), so every
  slide exports at a different resolution and aspect ratio.
- **Present mode** never auto-fits, so presenting shows whatever pan/zoom was left behind.

Introducing a fixed slide frame (16:9 / 4:3 / custom) is the single highest-leverage change in
this codebase and is a prerequisite for the rest of your roadmap. It is detailed as **F-01** in
document 6.

### Overall verdict

This fork is a **credible canvas engine to build on, not a product to extend**. What it gives
you for free is genuinely valuable and expensive to rebuild: a mature infinite canvas with
selection, transform handles, snapping, grouping, undo/redo, multi-page decks, a minimal present
mode, local persistence, a working multiplayer pattern, and 71 test files.

What it does not give you is most of the *product*: no slide frame, no templates, no animation,
no rich text (text is a plain `string` in a `<textarea>` — no bold, italic, or bullet lists), no
brand kit, no deck-level export, no PDF (stubbed with a 500 at
`apps/www/pages/api/export.ts:41`), no PPTX, no i18n.

Two structural risks you should weigh before committing, both detailed in document 6:

1. **The dependency floor is React 17.** `zustand@3` and `mobx-react-lite@3` predate
   `useSyncExternalStore` and are known to tear under React 18 concurrent rendering. A modern
   Next.js app (React 19, App Router) will need this resolved — this is the largest hidden cost
   in the whole assessment.
2. **This is a frozen 2021 fork with no upstream.** It was never published to npm, so there is
   nothing to pull fixes from. You own 100% of maintenance forever.

Before committing, run a short spike comparing against building the slide layer on **current
tldraw (v2/v3)**, which has first-class custom-shape APIs, rich text, and React 18/19 support —
at the cost of losing this fork's Deck layer and requiring a licensing review. Document 6 frames
that decision.
